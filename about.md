Hello!

I'm some kind of a nerd guy who loves code, Rock n' Roll, and cars (I currently own a 2015 Honda City EXL)! I'm a freak workaholic too!  


### More Information

I'm Currently finishing my Computer Science Bachelor at UFPB, Brazil. Love USA, many because I Lived in USA for 15 months studying Computer Science at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and I learned that the American culture is one of the most gorgeous in the world.
I was always curious about computer things, and started to work with it when I was a child, I mean, assembled my first good computer when I was 9 years. Today program is part of my life, and I really love it, I can't think myself doing something different. One of my favorite language is Swift, but I like other languages as C++, Java, Javascript as well.
