Hello! 

I'm some kind of a nerd guy who loves code, Rock n' Roll, and cars (I currently own a 2012 Ford Fiesta SE)! I'm a freak workaholic too! So don't blame on me and enjoy my GitHub Repositories!

### More Information

I relly dont have more informations about me, maybe one day I'll be updating this part of my website! HAHAHA
